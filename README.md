# dynamic-unga-voting
Repository for research on dynamic dimensionality estimation in roll call data.

This repository hosts the research paper and related materials for my research project "Estimating Dynamic Dimensionality in Roll Call Data: An Application to UNGA Voting." The study applies a Bayesian nonparametric framework to analyze the shifting political dimensions in UNGA roll call votes, uncovering shifts in the salience, or dimensionality, of political issues over time. The repository includes the current version of the full paper (PDF).
