Repository for research on dynamic dimensionality estimation in roll call data.

This repository hosts the research paper and related materials for my research project "Estimating Dynamic Dimensionality in Roll Call Data: An Application to UNGA Voting." The study applies a Bayesian nonparametric framework to analyze the shifting political dimensions in UNGA roll call votes, uncovering shifts in the salience, or dimensionality, of political issues over time. The repository includes the current version of the full paper (PDF).

# abstract

This paper develops and extends the research I presented in poster format at the JSQPS 2025 Winter Meeting, where I introduced an early version of a Bayesian model for uncovering ideological structure in United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) roll-call voting. In this revised version, I formalize the model, offer more substantive interpretations, expand the mathematical derivations, and respond directly to feedback received during the winter session.

The proposed model separates countries’ static ideological positions from the time-varying salience of issue dimensions. Although the assumption of static ideological positions may initially seem implausible, I show that this framework enables the estimation of *revealed ideological vectors*—expressed preferences that evolve as issue salience shifts. This allows for dynamic comparisons of countries’ ideological behavior, even across periods when some were not UNGA members. I also provide a clearer theoretical interpretation of the model and more detailed explanations of the estimated dimensions and ideological regimes.

Applied to over seventy years of UNGA voting data, the model recovers multiple interpretable dimensions—including Cold War alignment, North–South relations, human rights, and nuclear disarmament—and captures ideological divergence even among traditional allies. This research contributes methodologically to the analysis of high-dimensional data and substantively to our understanding of how global ideological alignments evolve in multilateral institutions.
